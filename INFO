This library adapts and extends from the WearAuthn app by Fabian Henneke
(https://github.com/FabianHenneke/WearAuthn)

The Authenticator and TransactionManager software are adaptations of some of 
WearAuthn's components that have been provisioned to be run on Android OS devices.
These were dettached from the UI/application layer in order to be used as a standalone
strong authenticator library.

The code has been extended to support:
- extra CTAP2 commands as defined in the FIDO2 CTAP specification (e.g. full client PIN)
